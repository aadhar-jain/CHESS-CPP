## How to try ?

Just download the zip file , extract it and open **main.cpp** file.
Compile it and game will start instantly.

*DON'T FORGET TO SWITCH TERMINAL TO FULL SCREEN*

- If a distorted format occurs at any point **(probably won't)**,use commands from keyboard:-
- **Ctrl + minus key(-)**              
*one or more times*

- **It will adjust the interface size ,  as per device screen.**


## User Guide
Instructions are quiet straight forward. A user menu will appear for the first time ,where different choices will be listed. Just follow written instructions and you will be good to go. 



## Features
- Ability to detect invalid moves, giving a error message , asking user to try again with a valid move.
- Scope of entering player names for both players , and game will tell you when is your chance by calling out your name.
- a board like pattern is printed everytime a move is made, to mimick actual chessboard layout and to display updated positions of peices.
- a help board will be present at right side, making it convenient for new users , to understand and play chess easily.
- Incorporates most of the rules and regulations of playing chess.
## Scope of Improvement
- Some of the pieces shouldn't make a move , if some other piece is present in front of them. eg- rook shoudn't move if any piece is in it's way.
- implementation of classes and objects in code, could make it much shorter in terms of lines of code
- use of vectors in place of array can be done
- suggestions for next move , if any player is stuck.

## Inspiration
The day I became capable of solving problems of programming , I have aspired to build something, that can enagage people. There are huge bulk of chess games , way more efficient out there, but for me *it was a stepping stone to create better projects in future.*

**I will be completing this project , address all shortcomings and then choose some problem that hasn't been addressed yet.**
